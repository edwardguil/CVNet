# Correlation Verification for Image Retrieval

This repository contains an unofficial Pytorch implementation of the image retrieval network proposed in the paper [Correlation Verification for Image Retrieval](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Lee_Correlation_Verification_for_Image_Retrieval_CVPR_2022_paper.html) [1]. While an official repository for this paper [exists](https://github.com/sungonce/CVNet/tree/main), the authors failed to release code to reproduce the results via training, citing intellectual property [issues](https://github.com/sungonce/CVNet/issues/1#issuecomment-1161781271). 

This repository aims to solve this. Leveraging the existing codebase, it aims to include the full network proposed in the paper, include a reproducable training loop, dataloaders and better OOP practices, encaspulated into a more understandble code base.
