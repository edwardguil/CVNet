# Correlation Verification for Image Retrieval
Welcome to an unofficial repository that houses a PyTorch implementation of the image retrieval network presented in the research paper, [Correlation Verification for Image Retrieval](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Lee_Correlation_Verification_for_Image_Retrieval_CVPR_2022_paper.html) [1]. An official repository for this paper does [exist](https://github.com/sungonce/CVNet/tree/main), but unfortunately, it lacks the comprehensive code necessary for reproducing training results due to cited intellectual property concerns.

This repository has been built with the objective to bridge this gap by providing a more complete and coherent codebase. Initiative has been taken to include a well-structured training loop and aimed to encapsulate the full essence of the network proposed in the original paper through better OOP design. This in hopes to promote more rapid and straightforward reproducibility and facilitates smoother training transitions on novel datasets.
